# Gemini Enterprise on GCP - FedRAMP High (gemini-stage-0)

This blueprint deploys the necessary infrastructure to host a Gemini Enterprise application on Google Cloud Platform, adhering to FedRAMP High compliance standards. It provisions a secure environment with networking, load balancing, access controls, and data stores for Vertex AI Search.

## Prerequisites & Manual Steps Before Apply

Before applying this Terraform module, ensure the following manual steps and configurations are completed:

1.  **Chrome Enterprise Premium:**
    *   Manually enable and configure Chrome Enterprise Premium within the Google Cloud Console for your organization. This is required for certain contextual awareness policies and configurations, adding to your zero-trust security posture. ([Learn how to purchase Chrome Enterprise Premium here](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/15832585?hl=en))

2.  **Google Workspace Groups for IAP:**
    *   In the [Google Workspace Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/), create the following groups:
        *   `gcp-gemini-enterprise-admins@<your-domain>`
        *   `gcp-gemini-enterprise-users@<your-domain>`
    *   Add the necessary users to these groups who will need access to the Gemini Enterprise application through the Identity-Aware Proxy.

3.  **OAuth Consent Screen:**
    *   In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen".
    *   Configure the OAuth consent screen. Select "Internal" user type if only for your organization. Provide an app name (e.g., "Gemini Enterprise IAP"), user support email, and developer contact information.

**IMPORTANT:** This blueprint is designed to be deployed in a **FedRAMP High GCP project**, to ensure a clean slate for meeting stringent FedRAMP High security and compliance requirements.

## IAM Permissions for Deployment

The user or service account applying this Terraform configuration needs the following IAM roles:

**Organization Level:**

*   `roles/accesscontextmanager.policyAdmin`: To manage Access Context Manager policies and levels.
*   `roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin`: To set organization policies.

**Project Level:**

*   `roles/compute.networkAdmin`: For all networking resources (VPC, subnets, firewalls, LBs, NEGs).
*   `roles/compute.securityAdmin`: For Cloud Armor security policies.
*   `roles/iap.admin`: To configure IAP on backend services.
*   `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`: To enable required APIs.
*   `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`: To manage project IAM bindings and service identities.
*   `roles/cloudkms.admin`: For KMS key rings, keys, and IAM permissions.
*   `roles/storage.admin`: For GCS buckets.
*   `roles/bigquery.admin`: For BigQuery datasets and tables.
*   `roles/discoveryengine.admin`: For all Discovery Engine resources.

### Achieving Stricter Least Privilege

The roles listed above provide the necessary permissions using standard Google Cloud predefined roles. For an even stricter adherence to the principle of least privilege, you can create **Custom IAM Roles**.

This involves identifying the minimum specific permissions required for each Terraform resource being deployed and creating custom roles containing only those permissions. For example, instead of `roles/compute.networkAdmin`, you would create a custom role with specific permissions like `compute.networks.create`, `compute.subnetworks.create`, etc.

**Steps to Implement Custom Roles:**

1.  **Analyze Permissions:** Carefully review the Terraform provider documentation for each resource used in this module to determine the exact IAM permissions needed for create, read, update, and delete operations.
2.  **Create Custom Role(s):** Define custom roles at the project or organization level, including only the permissions identified in step 1.
3.  **Grant Custom Role(s):** Assign the custom role(s) to the service account or user deploying the module.

**Considerations:**

*   Creating and maintaining custom roles requires significant effort and ongoing maintenance as the infrastructure evolves.
*   Using a dedicated Service Account with the predefined roles listed earlier is a balanced approach that provides good security separation.

Refer to the [Google Cloud IAM documentation on Custom Roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) for more details.

## Overall Architecture

The blueprint sets up the following key components:

1.  **Networking:** A dedicated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets
    *   Private Google Access subnet
    *   Regional Managed Proxy subnet (for the regional https load balancer)
    *   Regional Network Endpoint Group (INTERNET_FQDN_PORT) pointing to `vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com`.

2.  **Load Balancing:**
    *   **Stage 0 (This Blueprint):** Deploys a Regional External HTTP Load Balancer to direct all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
    *   **Stage 1 (gemini-stage-1):** After you upload a Google-managed certificate and launch the Gemini Enterprise application using the `gem4gov` CLI, the `gemini-stage-1` blueprint will configure the main Regional External HTTPS Load Balancer. This will include the frontend configuration, certificate attachment, and routing rules to the Gemini Enterprise application instance.

3.  **Security:**
    *   **Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP):** Enabled on the backend service in `load_balancer.tf`. IAP is configured to use pre-defined Access Context Manager levels to enforce contextual awareness policies for the prerequisite Google Workspace groups:
        *   `gcp-gemini-enterprise-admins@<your-domain>`: Requires the `strict_device` policy. This level enforces:
            *   US-based access.
            *   Access only during business hours (Mon-Fri, 7 AM - 9 PM ET).
            *   Access expiring at the end of 2026.
            *   Device must be Corp-owned, encrypted, have a screen lock, and be running macOS or Windows.
        *   `gcp-gemini-enterprise-users@<your-domain>`: Requires the `moderate_device` policy. This level enforces:
            *   US-based access.
            *   Access only during business hours (Mon-Fri, 7 AM - 9 PM ET).
            *   Access expiring at the end of 2026.
    *   **Chrome Enterprise Premium & Managed Browsers:** To meet the device policy requirements (especially for `strict_device`), users will typically need to use Chrome browsers managed by your Google Workspace organization through Chrome Enterprise Premium. This allows your organization to enforce security settings, extensions, and report on browser status, which feeds into the Access Context Manager device policy evaluation. Configuration is done within the [Google Workspace Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/) under [Chrome Browser management](https://admin.google.com/ac/chrome/browsers).
        *   To collect the necessary device information for Access Context Manager, ensure the **[Endpoint Verification](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/callobklhcbilhphinckomhgkigmfocg?utm_source=item-share-cb)** Chrome extension (ID: `callobklhcbilhphinckomhgkigmfocg`) is force-installed on managed browsers. This is extension is added to your users via the "[Apps & extensions](https://admin.google.com/ac/chrome/apps/user)" section within the Chrome Browser management section of the Google Workspace Admin Console.
    *   **Cloud Armor:** Regional security policy to allow US traffic and deny others.
    *   **Organization Policies:** Enforce security constraints.
    *   **IAM policies and Service Accounts:** Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Access Context Manager:** Policies defined in `access_policy.tf` for geo-location, time, and device attributes are bound to IAP in `load_balancer.tf`.
        *   **Customizable Business Hours:** The time-based access control (used in `moderate_device` and `strict_device` policies) can be customized using variables in your `terraform.tfvars` file:
            *   `access_start_hour`: Start hour (0-23 ET, default: 9)
            *   `access_end_hour`: End hour (0-23 ET, default: 17)
            *   `access_start_day`: Start day (1=Mon, 7=Sun, default: 1)
            *   `access_end_day`: End day (1=Mon, 7=Sun, default: 5)

4.  **Data Stores:** CMEK-encrypted GCS buckets and BigQuery datasets for Vertex AI Search, managed by the `discovery-engine` module.

## Deployment Steps

1.  Navigate to `blueprints/fedramp-high/gemini-enterprise/gemini-stage-0/`.
2.  Create a `terraform.tfvars` file based on the `terraform.tfvars.sample` sample, filling in all required values.
3.  Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
4.  Review the plan: `terraform plan`
5.  Apply the configuration: `terraform apply`
6.  Complete the "Manual Steps After Apply".

## Manual Steps After Apply

1.  **Populate Data Stores:**
    *   **GCS:** Upload your documents to the GCS buckets created by Terraform (see outputs `gcs_gemini_enterprise_data_buckets`).
    *   **BigQuery:** Ensure your BigQuery tables (defined in `var.bq_data_store_configs`) are populated with data.

2.  **Import Data to Discovery Engine:**
    *   **GCS:** Manually trigger data import from GCS to the Discovery Engine data stores. Example for one Data Store:
        ```bash
        # Obtain the Data Store ID from Terraform outputs gcs_discovery_engine_data_stores
        DATA_STORE_ID="<e.g., company-docs-gcs-data-store>"
        BUCKET_NAME="<e.g., your-gcp-project-id-company-docs-data>"
        PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
        GEOLOCATION="us" # Match var.geolocation

        gcloud discovery-engine data-stores import $DATA_STORE_ID \
          --project=$PROJECT_ID \
          --location=$GEOLOCATION \
          --gcs-source=gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/* \
          --data-schema=content
        ```
    *   **BigQuery:** The Data Connector will periodically refresh data. Check the status in the console.

3.  **Proceed to gemini-stage-1:** Once this stage is fully applied and manual steps are completed, you will run the `gem4gov` CLI to create the application engine, and then deploy the `gemini-stage-1` blueprint to configure the main load balancer frontend & routing rules to your customer instance.

## Outputs

This module provides outputs such as:

*   `gcs_discovery_engine_data_stores`: A map of the created GCS-based Data Store names.
*   `gcs_gemini_enterprise_data_buckets`: A map of the created GCS bucket names.
*   `bq_discovery_engine_data_store_ids`: A map of the Data Store IDs managed by the BigQuery connectors.
*   `gemini_enterprise_ip_address`: The reserved static IP for the load balancer.

These outputs are used by the "gem for Gov CLI" tool and the `gemini-stage-1` blueprint.
